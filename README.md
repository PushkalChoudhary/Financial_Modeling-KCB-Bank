## Key Model Schedules and Analysis

The model is structured to provide granular detail across critical banking functions:

### 1. Revenue & Expense Drivers
- **Interest Income Schedule:** Calculates interest based on client acquisition, average loan amounts, and specified interest rates for each loan category.

- **Operational Costs:** Includes Employee Costs (grade-wise hiring and salary escalation), Rental Expense, and Other Operational Expenses (e.g., ATM network expansion).

### 2. Capital Planning
- **Fixed Assets Schedule:** Tracks Capital Expenditure for Office Furniture/Fixtures and IT Infrastructure, with depreciation applied over useful economic lives.  
- **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) Analysis:** Projects CAR over 5 years and models additional equity infusion if required to meet the **regulatory minimum CAR target of 12%**.

### 3. Integrated Financial Statements
- **Income Statement:** Projects Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) using a corporate tax rate of 25%.  
- **Balance Sheet:** Ensures **Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity** using the Cash Flow Statement as a balancing item.  
- **Cash Flow Statement:** Projects net cash flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing activities.
