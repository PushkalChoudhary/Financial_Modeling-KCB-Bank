1) Kindly turn on iterative calculation in excel for model to work properly.
   STEPS:
   Go to File > Options > Formulas and select the Enable iterative calculation check box.

2) If the assumptions/inputs needed to be changed, it could be changed using the Inputs/Assumption sheet in the model.

3) Kindly do not edit any element in the core model as it may disturb the whole flow of the components in the model.
